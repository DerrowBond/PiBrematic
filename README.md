Clone a Raspberry Pi as a Brennenstuhl Brematic Gateway

This makes a Raspberry Pi, act like a real Brennenstuhl Brematic Gateway GWY433

All you need is a Raspberry Pi, and one of those cheap 433 Mhz transmitters, connected to Pi Pin 0.
You can use a different Pin by altering the source code here:

int iTransmitPin = 0;
